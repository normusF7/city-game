# City Game
A mobile building combination game prototype developed in Unity using the Zenject framework, inspired by "Merge Town".

## How to Play
- Move the camera by clicking and dragging the mouse across the game grid.
- To select a house, click on it, hold, and wait for a moment.
- To place the building, release the mouse on the desired grid cell, whether it already has a house or is empty.
- Currently, only three levels of houses are available.
- Houses can only be merged with those of the same level.

## Disclaimer
This is an early version of the game. As of now, only some foundational elements and minimal gameplay mechanics are implemented.
